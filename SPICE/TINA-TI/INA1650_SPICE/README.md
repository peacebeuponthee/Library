### Description

The INA1650-Q1 dual-channel and INA1651-Q1 single-channel (INA165x-Q1)	SoundPlus™ audio line receivers achieve an extremely high	common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 91 dB while maintaining an ultra-low THD+N of –119 dB at 1	kHz for 20-dBu signal levels. Unlike other line receiver products, the INA165x-Q1 CMRR is	characterized over temperature and tested in production to deliver consistent performance in a wide variety of applications.

The INA165x-Q1 devices operate over a very-wide-supply range of ±2.25 V to ±12 V. In	addition to the line-receiver channels, a buffered midsupply reference output is included to allow	the INA165x-Q1 to be configured for dual-supply or single-supply applications. The midsupply output	can be used as a bias voltage for other analog circuitry in the signal chain.

The INA1650-Q1 features a unique internal layout for lowest crosstalk and freedom from	interactions between channels, even when overdriven or overloaded.
